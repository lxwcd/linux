# 修改软件仓库的镜像源
例如安装 ubuntu22.04 后，进入 `/etc/apt` 目录下可以看到 ` sources.list` 的文件
初始部分内容为：
```bash
# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to
# newer versions of the distribution.
deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main restricted
# deb-src http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main restricted

## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the
## distribution.
deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates main restricted
# deb-src http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates main restricted

## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu
## team. Also, please note that software in universe WILL NOT receive any
## review or updates from the Ubuntu security team.
deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy universe
# deb-src http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy universe
deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates universe
# deb-src http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates universe

deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security main restricted
```

1. 其中 `deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security main restricted` 的含义如下：
```bash
The line `deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy-security main restricted` in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file on Ubuntu adds a software repository to the system that contains security updates for the current release of Ubuntu which is "Jammy" in this case. Here is what each component of the line means:

- `deb`: Indicates that this is a binary package repository.
- `http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/`: Specifies the URL of the repository. In this case, it is the URL for the Ubuntu security repository.
- `jammy-security`: Specifies the repository's distribution name. In this case, it refers to the security updates for Ubuntu Jammy.
- `main restricted`: Specifies the components of the repository that should be used. In this case, it is set to use `main` and `restricted` components, which includes packages that are officially supported by Ubuntu.

With this repository added to the system's `sources.list` file, the `apt` package manager will be able to download and install any security updates that are available for the installed packages on the system, helping to keep the system secure and up to date with the latest security patches.
````

2. `deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security main restricted` 和 
`deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy main restricted` 的区别为：
```bash
The main difference between the two lines in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file is that they reference different Ubuntu repositories.

The line `deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy main restricted` is pointing to the main Ubuntu repository, which contains the packages that are officially supported by Ubuntu. `main` and `restricted` are two of the four main components of this repository.

On the other hand, `deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy-security main restricted` is pointing to the Ubuntu security repository, which contains security updates for packages in the main Ubuntu repository. This repository only contains security patches and does not include all packages available in the main repository.

In other words, the first line references the main repository while the second line references the security repository. The main repository contains all packages that are officially supported by Ubuntu, while the security repository contains only security patches for the packages in the main repository.
```







可以将仓库地址改为其他镜像源地址
如清华大学镜像网站 ubuntu 网站为：[https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu/)，其内容和 ubuntu 官网相同，因此替换源只用将 `cn.archive.ubuntu.com` 替换为 `mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn`

```bash
[root@docker apt]$ sed -i.orig 's/cn.archive.ubuntu.com/mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/g' sources.list
```
